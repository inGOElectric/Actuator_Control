# Actuator_Control
This repo controls various actuator controls

working on a project to control a motorized actuator based on throttle voltage input and serial commands. 
The actuator moves between specific positions (e.g., 38mm, 42mm, and 50mm), and the program reads the voltage from an analog input to determine the current position of the actuator. 
Then, based on the received serial commands, it adjusts the actuator's position by extending or contracting it.
